This package is a python module together with a couple of ipython
notebooks, for demonstrating matched filtering -- the basic
data-analysis method used by LIGO (among others).  There is a lot of
explanation and sample code in the main notebook, which is
`MatchedFilteringDemonstration.ipynb`.

To run the code
===============
If you are reading this README from the github project page, you
should first download the package to your own computer with something
like
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/MOBle/MatchedFiltering.git
Otherwise, you are presumably reading this in the code itself.

You will need a reasonably current installation of python, along with
[ipython-notebook][1] and [pylab][2].  For full functionality, you
will also need the [pyaudio module][3].

First, go into the top directory of the code: `MatchedFiltering`.  In
it, there should be an executable file called `CreateSounds.py` which
will create a set of WAV files from real gravitational-waveform data.
These files will be needed later.

Now, from that same directory, issue the command
    ipython notebook --pylab
This will start an ipython session, but should switch to your default
web browser, where you will interact with the session.  Next, click on
the file `MatchedFilteringDemonstration.ipynb`, and follow the 
instructions in there.
