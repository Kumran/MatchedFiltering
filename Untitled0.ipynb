(Except, of course, that sound requires air, while gravitational waves travel through spacetime itself.)  In fact, if you go to the LIGO control room, they'll often play the data over speakers, because this is a really useful way of thinking about it.  It even happens to be in the right range for human hearing.  So we'll be listening to LIGO data and gravitational waveforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that will just be one of the data-analysis techniques we use.  We'll be looking at Fourier transforms, and introducing matched filters.  Finally, we'll do the some actual LIGO data analysis with some real (simulated) gravitational waveforms and LIGO data.\n",

When you listened to the noise alone, did you hear anything unsteady -- any clicks, pops, or generally sudden noises?  Probably not.  The noise didn't get louder or quieter.

To do this, we measure the **\"match\"** between the data $d$ and template signal $s$, which filters the data using our knowledge of the expected signal and the typical noise in the detector, and then measures the total power in the filtered result.

      "An analogy might be helpful.  The bass and treble controls on a stereo control the deep and high-pitched sounds.  Sometimes, you'll find stereos with bass, treble, and mid-range -- the frequency ranges been split up into finer bins.  Fancier stereos will split them up into even finer bins, and have more controls.  You can adjust these \"equalizer\" controls to make certain frequency ranges louder or quieter, depending on whether you want to hear sounds in that frequency or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Fourier transform divides the frequencies into as many bins as possible, and matched filtering adjusts each of the corresponding controls.  In fact, for any template signal, matched filtering gives you the best possible way to adjust all of those controls to hear that particular signal.\n",

      "We start out with the amplitude of the Fourier transform of the data, $\\tilde{d}_{f_i}$, and let's just think of one particular frequency for now.  If our expected signal $\\tilde{s}_{f_i}$ is small, we want to ignore this part of the data; if $\\tilde{s}_{f_i}$ is large, we want to accentuate this part of the data.  So the first step in our filter is to take the product\n",

      "On the other hand, if the detector's noise at this frequency is large, we expect the data to be large, but useless garbage.  So we want to ignore the data whenever there's a lot of noise.  To do that, we divide by the noise at this frequency $\\tilde{n}_{f_i}$.  But we don't want to just level the playing field for the data; we want to really eliminate that bad data even from the signal &mdash; so we divide by *two* powers of the noise:\n",

      "This isn't quite the whole story, though, because the Fourier transform really involves two pieces of information: the amplitude and the phase.  The phase $\\phi_{f_i}$ tells us exactly where the sine with frequency $f_i$ hits its peak.  And if $d$ hits its peak when $s$ hits a trough, we don't really have the same signal.  So we bring in one more factor to our filter:\n",

Now, for each $f_i$, the quantity above is large whenever the noise is small and the expected signal agrees with the observed data &mdash; as long as our expected signal is really in the data.\n",
