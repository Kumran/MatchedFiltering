But that's a pretty narrow purpose, and most of you will not get involved in GWs.  So I want to also give you some exposure to a few other ideas that hopefully will have more broad application to all of you when you go into other fields.  And we'll use matched-filtering as a way into those other ideas."

I'll make this analogy that LIGO is just an extraordinary microphone, and we'll listen to the sounds a GW makes, and the sounds of the LIGO instrument itself.  Then, we'll see that FFTs are a really powerful way of analyzing these sounds, and matched filtering is a really sensitive way of measuring those FFTs.\n",

      "But of course, while we're doing that, I also want to give you a little flavor of data analysis.  Pretty much all of you either are working on or will work on data analysis at some point, and there are some very general rules and ideas that can be applied to basically any type of data analysis.  So I'll want to use this stuff as a sort of analogy for other types of data analysis, so hopefully you can apply these principles to your own work."

It's not always the fastest at any computation, but since most of your time is spent writing programs (rather than running them), that's not usually a big problem.  And new developments are making python just as fast as even C/C++ in a lot of cases.\n",

      "\n",
      "Mathematica is better at symbolic math (for now).  But otherwise, python is more useful and general.  And the ipython notebook makes it better at interactive stuff.  So here's my unsolicited advice: if you're deciding what programming language to learn, go with python.  There are nerdier options out there, but not many more broadly useful options.  And if you're using python interactively, you'll want to us ipython (which is just a different interface) or -- better yet -- the ipython notebook."
